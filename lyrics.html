        I saw her in the rightest way
        Looking like Anne Hathaway
        Laughing while she hit her pen and coughed, and coughed
        And then she came up to my knees
        Begging, "Baby, would you please
        Do the things you said you'd do to me, to me?"

        Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
        And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
        I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
        My mom says that she's worried, but I'm covered in His favor
        And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
        I sleep so I can see you, 'cause I hate to wait so long
        I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long

        She took my fingers to her mouth
        The kind of thing that makes you proud
        That nothing else had ever worked out, worked out
        And maybe I tried other things
        But nothing can capture the sting
        Of the venom she's gonna spit out right now
 
        Oh, won't you kiss me on the mouth and love me like a sailor?
        And when you get a taste, can you tell me what's my flavor?
        I don't believe in God, but I believe that you're my savior
        I know that you've been worried, but you're dripping in my favor
        And when we're getting dirty, I forget all that is wrong
        I sleep so I can see you, 'cause I hate to wait so long
        I sleep so I can see you, and I hate to wait so long
 
        And we can run away to the walls inside your house
        I can be the cat, baby, you can be the mouse
        And we can laugh off things that we know nothing about
        We can go forever, until you wanna sit it out
